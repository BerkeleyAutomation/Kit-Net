**Installation**: 

Create a python3 virtual environment and after enabling the data generation virtual environment, install the necessary requirements as follows:

1. Run pip install requirements.txt to install all external requirements
2. Run python setup.py develop to install unsupervised_rbt package

**Basic Usage**: 

You will mostly interact with files in the tools folder, which all have corresponding files in the cfg/tools/ folder
which specify paramaters for these files. 
The controller folder contains scripts for running the simulation experiments to orient objects given a model trained on the self-supervised trask.
<!-- The shuffle dataset script shuffles the tensor datasets generated by the data generation scripts to make sure the training process is iid. -->

**Self-Supervised Rotation Prediction Task**:

Data Generation: See tools/data_gen_quat.py for generating data for the task. See cfg/tools/data_gen_quat.yaml for config parameters
The dataset used for Kit-Net is called 872objv3

Example usage: python tools/data_gen_quat.py {dataset_name}

Training: Make sure to either generate data or use pre-generated data. For training see tools/unsup_rbt_train_quat.py

Example usage: python tools/unsup_rbt_train_quat.py {dataset_name}. Example dataset is 872objv3

Testing: Same as train except with a --test flag. 

Example usage: python tools/unsup_rbt_train_quat.py {dataset_name} --test. Example dataset is 872objv3

**Prismatic Cavity Task**:

Create a dataset with tools/prismatic_cavity.py, then do training and testing as above

**Simulation Experiments Controller**:

In controller/pyrender_controller.py you can run the orienting objects experiments.

In controller/prism_controller.py you can run the simulation experiments for Kit-Net


<!-- **Downstream Task: Pose Agnostic Object Matching**:

Data Generation: See tools/data_gen_downstream.py for generating data for the task. There is already a dataset that has been generated earlier called downstream

Example usage: python tools/data_gen_downstream.py

Training: Make sure to either generate data or use pre-generated data. For training see tools/semisup_obj_matching.py for
training with initialization from self supervised rotation prediction task and tools/sup_obj_matching.py for training with
random initialization

Example usage: python tools/semisup_obj_matching.py {dataset_name} or python tools/sup_obj_matching.py {dataset_name}. For now can use
the dataset called downstream

**Downstream Task: Pose Agnostic Object Classification**:

Data Generation: See tools/data_gen.py for generating data for the task. There is already a dataset that has been generated earlier called xyz-axis-obj-pred_shuffled. Use argument objpred to generate data for pose agnostic object classification

Example usage: python tools/data_gen.py {dataset_name}

Training: Make sure to either generate data or use pre-generated data. For training see tools/semisup_obj_prediction.py for
training with initialization from self supervised rotation prediction task and tools/train_obj_prediction.py for training with
random initialization

Example usage: python tools/semisup_obj_prediction.py {dataset_name} or python tools/sup_obj_prediction.py {dataset_name}. For now can use
the dataset called xyz-axis-obj-pred_shuffled. -->
